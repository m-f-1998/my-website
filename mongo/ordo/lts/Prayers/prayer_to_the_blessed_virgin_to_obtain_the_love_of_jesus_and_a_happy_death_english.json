Thou who so much desirest to see Jesus loved, if thou lovest me, this is the favour that I now ask of thee, to obtain for me a great love for Jesus Christ.\n\nThou obtainest from thy Son whatever thou pleasest; pray, then, for me, and console me. Obtain for me a great love for thee, who of all creatures, art the most loving and beloved of God.\n\nAnd through that grief which thou didst suffer on Calvary, when thou didst behold Jesus expire on the Cross, obtainest for me a happy death, that by loving Jesus and thee, my Mother, I may come to love thee forever in heaven.\nAmen."}
