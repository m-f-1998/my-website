Let me hate myself and love Thee, And do all things for the sake of Thee. Let me humble myself, and exalt Thee, and think of nothing else but Thee. Let me die to myself, and live in Thee, and accept whatever happens as coming from Thee. Let me forsake myself and walk after Thee, and ever desire to follow Thee.\r\n\r\nLet me flee from myself, and turn to Thee, that so I may deserve to be defended by Thee. Let me fear for myself, let me fear Thee, and be amongst those who are chosen by Thee. Let me distrust myself, and trust in Thee, and will to obey for the love of Thee. Let me cleave to nothing but only to Thee, and be poor for the sake of Thee. Look upon me, that I may love Thee.\r\n\r\nCall me, that I may see Thee and for ever possess Thee. Amen."}
