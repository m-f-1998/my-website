He hath brought me up, on the water of refreshment:\r\n\r\nHe hath converted my soul. He hath led me on the paths of justice, for his own name's sake.\r\n\r\nFor though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evils, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me.\r\nThou hast prepared a table before me against them that afflict me. Thou hast anointed my head with oil; and my chalice which inebriateth me, how goodly is it!\r\n\r\nAnd thy mercy will follow me all the days of my life. And that I may dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days."}
