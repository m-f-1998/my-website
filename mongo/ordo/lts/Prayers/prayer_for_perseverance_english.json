Keep me in Thy love; keep me in Thy grace to the end of my life. The road I have to traverse in so difficult, that without Thee I should fear to venture upon it.\r\n\r\nIn a short time I shall return to my daily occupations: I shall continue my life of yesterday; I shall be exposed to the same temptations, I shall find myself with my usual faults.\r\n\r\nBut Jesus, Thou Who didst help the saints, Though has come to me. Stay, oh, stay with me and do Thou by Thy grace help me to persevere in all my words and actions modesty, meekness, and humility. Help me to make Thy presence within me visible to all; let others see in me the sweetness of Thy charity and kindness."}
