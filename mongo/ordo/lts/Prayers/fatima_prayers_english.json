I ask pardon of You for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not hope and do not love You!\n\nO Jesus, it is for love of You, for the conversion of sinners, and in reparation for the sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nO my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of Hell. Lead all souls to heaven, especially those most in need of Thy mercy.\n\nO Most Holy Trinity, I adore You! My God, my God, I love You in the most Blessed Sacrament!\n\nMost Holy Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Ghost I offer You the most precious Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ present in all the tabernacles of the world, in reparation for the sacrileges, outrages and indifferences by which He Himself is offended. And through the infinite merits of His most Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I beg of you the conversion of poor sinners."}
