# My Website Repository

This repository contains the source code for my personal website and its connected API.  
To run the server locally, ensure you have a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following environment variables:

- `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`
- `SMTP_HOST`
- `SMTP_USER`
- `SMTP_PASS`
- `SMTP_PORT`

These are required for reCAPTCHA verification and email functionality.
